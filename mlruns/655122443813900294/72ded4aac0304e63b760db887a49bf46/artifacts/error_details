'Metric' object has no attribute 'loss'. See valid attributes below.

    Class for computing evaluation metrics for YOLOv8 model.

    Attributes:
        p (list): Precision for each class. Shape: (nc,).
        r (list): Recall for each class. Shape: (nc,).
        f1 (list): F1 score for each class. Shape: (nc,).
        all_ap (list): AP scores for all classes and all IoU thresholds. Shape: (nc, 10).
        ap_class_index (list): Index of class for each AP score. Shape: (nc,).
        nc (int): Number of classes.

    Methods:
        ap50(): AP at IoU threshold of 0.5 for all classes. Returns: List of AP scores. Shape: (nc,) or [].
        ap(): AP at IoU thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95 for all classes. Returns: List of AP scores. Shape: (nc,) or [].
        mp(): Mean precision of all classes. Returns: Float.
        mr(): Mean recall of all classes. Returns: Float.
        map50(): Mean AP at IoU threshold of 0.5 for all classes. Returns: Float.
        map75(): Mean AP at IoU threshold of 0.75 for all classes. Returns: Float.
        map(): Mean AP at IoU thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95 for all classes. Returns: Float.
        mean_results(): Mean of results, returns mp, mr, map50, map.
        class_result(i): Class-aware result, returns p[i], r[i], ap50[i], ap[i].
        maps(): mAP of each class. Returns: Array of mAP scores, shape: (nc,).
        fitness(): Model fitness as a weighted combination of metrics. Returns: Float.
        update(results): Update metric attributes with new evaluation results.
